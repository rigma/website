Software engineer for 2 years, I’m passionate about new technologies and science in general,
and that’s why I have decided to make my career out of it by mastering the art of coding to be 
able to solve all kinds of technical issues.

Currently I'm looking for a job position of a backend or fullstack developer, and I'll be happy 
to exchange with you about this project of mine.
