I am graduated sofware engineer from [Efrei Paris](https://eng.efrei.fr/) since 2018. I'm Romain, but I prefer to be named
"rigma" on the web. In life, I'm seeing myself as a backend devloper, but I can use my skills for other kind of developement
like frontend or system programming for instance.

What more can I say? I'm also a passionate about science in general, as well as video games and cartoons. I like to make pastries
too during my spare time, espacially [crÃªpes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe).

To reach me, you cand send me a message [on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/romain-failla) or [an email](mailto:rigbuntu@gmail.com).
